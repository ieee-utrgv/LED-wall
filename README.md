# LED-wall

The LED strips are going to be operated through micro-controllers (uC). These uC's will be programmed through a software called MPLABX IDE and in 'C'. 

Downloading MPLABX IDE and the compiler:
	-Go to the following webiste: http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide
	-Scroll down and find 'MPLAB X IDE' in the "downloads" tab
		-Here you will find the latest version of MPLAB, download the one needed for your device
	-Now go to the following website to download the compiler: http://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers
	-Scroll down and find 'MPLAB XC8' in the "downloads" tab
		-download the one needed for your device

You should now be able to open the project and code to make modifications or view what has been done so far

There is no way to test the code (that I know of) other than connecting to the uC and programming the code onto it to test with a power supply and either oscilloscope or an LED test strip. If you would like to test your code, contact me (Ronald) so that I can help you set up the hardware. I have everything needed for this. Penelope should have my number if you need it.
